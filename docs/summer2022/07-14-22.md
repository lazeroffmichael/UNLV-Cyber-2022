## üîë KeePass Setup

!!! info "What Is KeePass?"

    KeePass is a way to manage passwords

    [KeePass Website Link](https://keepass.info/)

??? success "How It Works"

    - An encrypted file stores your password hashes (.kdb or .kdbx)

    - Decrypt the file with a master password

    - There are many KeePass clients which support the encrypted file format

??? examples "Why Use KeePass"

    - Open source - all the code is available freely and security vetted

    - You can sync your KeePass database to all your devices

    - Its free (depending on the client) üí∞

    - You do not have to rely on an outside service to protect your information

??? info "Steps"

    **Install a KeePass client**

    ```
    sudo apt install keepassxc
    ```

    **Open the program**

    ```
    keepassxc
    ```

    **Create a new database**

    ![create](assets/keepassdatabasecreate.png) 

    - You can keep all the default settings the same

    **Database credentials**

    Create a master password that you have never used before, and do not write
    this down.

    **Create A TryHackMe Password**

    ![password](assets/newpassword.png)

??? warning "Storing Your Database"

    - You are in charge of handling your password file

    - I recommend storing it in your google drive account or some other cloud storage

    - Make sure you remember your password - if you forget it there is no retrieving passwords

    - If you want to access your passwords on a new computer, you can download
    a client for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) - there are many
    clients and they all do similar things.
