    Visit the website and register an account

    There are a variety of challenges from many different topics

    There is no specific ordering of difficulty - some may be harder than 
    others even with lower point values - so try all of them.

    There are approximately ~45 open questions, and I can provide more if necessary.

!!! warning "Rules"

    2. Do not give the answers to others

    3. You may ask for hints
