??? examples "Over the wire"

    Lets perform some capture the flag challenges on web applications

    [natas Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas)

    For each challenge, just change the number in the link to get to the next
    challenge. The username is just `natas` and the number. 

    Natas 1: natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org

    Natas 2: natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org

    ...

    Inspiration and more solutions: [OTW](https://axcheron.github.io/writeup
    s/otw/natas/)

    === "Level 0"

        View page source for the password (right click)

    === "Level 1"

        View page source for the password (shortcut or more tools in sidebar)

    === "Level 2"

        View page source and see files/pixel.png for the src.

        Open natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files for the users.txt file

    === "Level 3"

        Visit natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt to find the disallow
        endpoint

    === "Level 4"

        Intercept the request to natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org

        You will need to change the referer header to the link shown on the page
        before forwarding the request. Once it works it will show the password.

    === "Level 5"

        Intercept the request to natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org

        Change the logged_in cookie to 1. 

    === "Level 6"

        Source code shows "includes/secret.inc"

        go to natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc to get the 
        secret

    === "Level 7"

        The source code says that the answer is at etc/natas_webpass/natas8

        Set that endpoint to the page variable in the search query to get the
        answer

    === "Level 8"

        Source shows there is secret that we have to check against:

        "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362"

        To get this answer, a binary to hex conversion, then a reversal, then
        an encoding into base64 is performed

        Reverse the steps with python to get the secret

        ```python
        >>> import base64
        >>> by = bytes.fromhex(key)[::-1] # convert hex to bytes then reverse
        >>> base64.decodebytes(by) # decode base64
        ```

        ```
