## üîë Intro To Kali Linux

??? question "What is Kali Linux?"

    Kali is a cyber-focused "flavor" of Linux that has many tools already
    preinstalled that cybersecurity professionals use

??? question "Why live boot from USB?"

    When we live boot from the USB, we do not have to affect any operating 
    systems already loaded on the computer. Furthermore, if anything breaks
    we can just restart the computer.

!!! success "Your Tasks"

    === "Boot From Live USB"
         
        Get to the boot menu and choose UEFI
        
    === "Open The Terminal"
        
        Open the terminal with the icon in the top left, or do Ctrl+Alt+T

    === "Use `ls`"

        `ls` in the terminal will show the contents of the directory you are in.
        
        When you first open the terminal, you should be in the `~` directory 
        called the `Home` directory.

        Get back here using `cd ~` or just cd from any other directory.

    === "Create a new folder on the Desktop"

        In your terminal, `cd ~/Desktop`

        Once you have changed the directory in the terminal, you can make a folder
        with `mkdir <name>` where `<name>` is the name of your folder.

        A new folder should now appear on the Desktop

    === "Add a file to your created folder"

        Create a file with `touch <filename>` where `<filename>` is the name
        of your file.

    === "Open the manual page for the echo command"
        
        `man echo`

        Scroll down with `j`, and scroll up with `k`. Quit the man page with `q`

    === "Test echo in the terminal"

        `echo Hello World`

        It should `echo` the text after the command üòè

    === "Use echo to add text to your file"

        We will use the `pipe` -> `|`

        `echo Hello World | <filename>`

        We want to echo `Hello World` to sdout, and we want whatever is echoed
        to be piped into our file. The result is that the Hello World should 
        show up in the file.

    === "Use `cat`"

        `cat` will output the contents of a file to the console.

        `cat <filename>` should display `Hello World` if the last command
        was done properly.

Once you have completed all the tasks, browse through the preinstalled Kali 
apps and see if you recognize the names of any of them.

## üêç Intro To Python Programming


!!! info "Practice Options"

    === "Self practice making a calculator"

        Your task is to make a calculator in python that:

        1. Outputs a message using `print()` that welcomes the user to the
        calculator

        2. Reads in a number from the user using `input()`. Note we will assume
        that what the user enters is a valid number

        3. Reads in a second number from the user using `input()`

        4. Adds the first number and second number together, and prints that to
        the console using `print()`


        Example Interaction

        ```
        Welcome to the Python calculator!
        Enter a number: 2
        Enter a second number: 6
        The numbers added together are: 8
        ```

    === "IPv4 validator as a class"

        ??? success "Valid IP"
           
               These are just some of the rules for a valid IPv4 address, and 
               we will learn more when we talk about the internet.

               1. In the form `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`
               2. Each `xxx` is a number from 0-255
               3. The first `xxx` cannot be 0 

        ```
        Enter your IPv4 address: 100.25.62.78
        Status: Valid
        ```

        ```
        Enter your IPv4 address: 256.22.128.98
        Status: Invalid
        ```

        ```
        Enter your IPv4 address: 0.22.128.98
        Status: Invalid
        ```

        ```
        Enter your IPv4 address: 98.67.54
        Status: Invalid
        ```
